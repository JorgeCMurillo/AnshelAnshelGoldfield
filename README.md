An initial attempt at the AAG key exchange. Limited because the public conjugates are not enciphered to prevent someone from easily finding a,b. and the left normal form computation takes a long time to encipher each conjugate. Requires Sage installation, but if that's not possible you can run the same code on cocalc.com.
